### Template file syntax

The template file support the following placeholders:

* `{{previousIssueURL}}`: this will be replace by the URL of the previous weekly issue
* `{{$role}}`: a placeholder containing one of the specified role (from the `roles` input of the action) will be replaced by the GitHub handler of the person who has been assigned this role.

Also, the Markdown preamble will be parsed out and removed from the final issue body.
